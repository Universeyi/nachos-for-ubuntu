# Makefile for:
#	coff2noff -- converts a normal MIPS executable into a Nachos executable
#
# This is a GNU Makefile.  It must be used with the GNU make program.
# At UW, the GNU make program is /software/gnu/bin/make.
# In many other places it is known as "gmake".
# You may wish to include /software/gnu/bin/ early in your command
# search path, so that you will be using GNU make when you type "make".
#
#  Use "make" to build the executable(s)
#  Use "make clean" to remove .o files
#  Use "make distclean" to remove all files produced by make, including
#     the executable
